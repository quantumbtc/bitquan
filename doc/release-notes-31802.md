A new (experimental) Mining interface was introduced to support Stratum v2 or other mining client software, see #31098. When the node is started with `bitquantum node -m -ipcbind=unix` the node will listen on a unix socket for IPC client connections. The `-m` option launches a new binary `bitquantum-node` instead of `bitquantumd`.

IPC connectivity introduces new dependencies (see [multiprocess.md](multiprocess.md)), which are only included in the `bitquantum-node` and `bitquantum-gui` binaries (not in `bitquantumd` and `bitquantum-qt`). Those new binaries are now built by default (controlled by `ENABLE_IPC`). If you don't intend to use IPC, nothing changes and there is no need to use `bitquantum -m`, `bitquantum-node` or `bitquantum-gui`(#31802)
